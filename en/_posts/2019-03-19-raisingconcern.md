description: The Secretary for Security, John Lee, discussed with the representatives from the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong regarding the amendments to the Fugitives bill. The Manufacturers' Association said that they would raise concerns over the amendments to the economic crimes and relevant safeguards covered by the Fugitives bill. They considered that the broad and controversial scope involved by the amendments to the bill might make businessmen breaking the law inadvertently. If the Government rushed to amend the legislation in the absence of an extensive consultation and consensus, it would only hurt the confidence of the business sector. The Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce stated that there was considerable doubts in the extradition of prisoners with lesser offence.
