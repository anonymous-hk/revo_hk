description: The Executive Council exempted nine extraditable offences regarding bankruptcy, company law, securities, intellectual property rights, environmental pollution, imports and exports, computers, customs duties, and false trade descriptions of goods. The application threshold for extradition was lifted from crimes that are subject to imprisonment of one year or above to crimes that are liable on conviction upon indictment to imprisonment for 3 years or above. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce issued press releases to welcome the Government's exemption of nine economic crimes. Yet it has failed to allay public concerns.
