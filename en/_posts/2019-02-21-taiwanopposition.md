description: The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) in Taiwan does not agree that the Hong Kong Government amends the law on the premise of the One-China Principle. The Taiwan Government will not accept any actions aimed at eradicating national sovereignty. Therefore, Taiwan hopes that the Hong Kong Government will properly handle the case with the consideration of the well-being of both peoples.
